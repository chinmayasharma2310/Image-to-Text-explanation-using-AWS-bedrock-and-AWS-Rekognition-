# Image-to-Text-explanation-using-AWS-bedrock-and-AWS-Rekognition-

we will see using computer vision (Amazon Rekognition) to extract labels/concepts from images, and then leveraging Amazon Bedrock large language models to convert those labels into descriptive captions or paragraphs.

**Use cases :**
Here are some potential use cases for this approach :

**Image captioning** : Create alt-text and captions for photos automatically for visual search engines or to increase accessibility. Beneficial for social media, web content, and e-commerce websites.

**Scene summarization** : Concisely summarize pictures of places, buildings, activities, etc. to communicate important information. It could facilitate visual search for tourism or real estate websites.

**Assistive technology** : Help visually impaired users understand contents of images. Integrate with screen readers to voice summarize images as they encounter.

**Search improvement** : Enhance search engine optimization (SEO) and picture search relevancy by using produced captions and descriptions.

**Metadata generation** : Large image and media libraries can be automatically tagged and annotated with descriptive terms to improve discoverability and organization.
